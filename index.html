            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                through daily experiences.</p>

                disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination
                by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various
                forms of education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many factors influence the success of education. Psychological factors
                include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status,
                ethnicity, and gender, are often associated with discrimination. Other factors encompass access to
                educational technology, teacher quality, and parental involvement.

                The primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. It delves into the nature
                of education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement.</p>
